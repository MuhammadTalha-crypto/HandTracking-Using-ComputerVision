# HandTracking-Using-ComputerVision
This is the Hand Tracking Module that can be used in the vast range of hand &amp; Gesture based projects. 
You don't have to write the code for each project or you can just download this module and import it in your code and 70% of your work is already done.

I have used libraries like OpenCV, mediapipe and pycaw to read, process and extract the points of the hand for tracking purposes.
